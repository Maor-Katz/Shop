          Welcome to Megasport shop, your number one source for all things wights, cloths, tools. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of products, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
Founded in 1990 by Maor Katz , Megasport has come a long way from its beginnings in a starting location, ie: home office, toolshed, Houston, TX. When Maor first started out, his/her passion for helping other parents be more eco-friendly, providing the best equipment 

for his fellow musicians drove him to do intense research, quit her day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store.

We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Maor, CEO
